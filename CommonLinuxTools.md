* lynis
``` 
Lynis is a security auditing tool for Linux and Unix systems. It checks
the system and software configurations, to determine any  improvements.
All details are logged in a log file. Findings and other data is stored
in a report file, which can be used to create auditing reports.   Lynis
can  be  run as a cronjob, or from the command line. Lynis prefers root
permissions (or sudo), so it can access all parts of the  system,  how‐
ever it not required (see pentest mode).
```

* xtrlock
```
xtrlock locks the X server till the user enters their password  at  the
keyboard.

While  xtrlock  is  running, the mouse and keyboard are grabbed and the
mouse cursor becomes a padlock.  Output displayed by  X  programs,  and
windows  put  up  by new X clients, continue to be visible, and any new
output is displayed normally.

The mouse and keyboard are returned when the user types their password,
followed  by Enter or Newline.  If an incorrect password is entered the
bell is sounded.  Pressing Backspace or Delete erases one character  of
a  password  partially  typed; pressing Escape or Clear clears anything
that has been entered.

If too many attempts are made in too short a  time  further  keystrokes
generate bells and are otherwise ignored until a timeout has expired.

The  X  server  screen saver continues to operate normally; if it comes
into operation the display may be restored by the usual means of touch‐
ing a key (Shift, for example) or the mouse.
